# List of notable tests and what they test for

`Steyr_TMP` -> Include dot points, such as in the `Users` heading

`Cardinalis` -> same, but smaller (easier to test)


`Heckler_%26_Koch` -> Multiple links to the same page. In this case, these:
```
	Blowback_(arms)
	Blowback_(arms)#Gas_delayed
	Blowback_(arms)#Roller_delayed
```
Therefore can use this to test that,
1) Everything after the `#` symbol is not considered
2) the resulting links don't get stored multiple times (i.e. only one entry for `Blowback_(arms)`

`Br%C3%BCgger_%26_Thomet_GL06` -> same, but smaller (easier to test)
```
	Non-lethal_weapon
	Non-lethal_weapon#Ammunition
```


`Brügger_&_Thomet` (as an input) -> test to see whether it'll sort out the ampersand and the umlaut.
```
	$ python3 get_links3.py -v 1 -a dfs -d 1 -s Brügger_&_Thomet -t Steel
	[1] 5400
	bash: _Thomet: command not found

	$ Namespace(algorithm='dfs', depth=1, start='Brügger_', target='Adolf_Hitler', verbosity=1)
	Visiting: Brügger_
```
- Side note: I think the ampersand `&` must be escaped in the command line when entering the command
- `python3 get_links3.py -s Brügger_\&_Thomet`
- Using `unidecode` seems to make it work.


`List_of_chemical_compounds_with_unusual_names` -> There are only 13 outgoing links, but there should be hundreds
- Need to include tables in the outgoing links


`AK-102` -> As a follow-up, want to avoid the templates at the bottom of the page.
