| Projects
+------------------------------

- Single-input Based Game
	- Events
	Adv:
		- Simple
		- Can be easily incremented/good deliverable/milestones
		- Can be modified into different projects
	Disadv:
		- Threads
		- Final product relies on a lot of non-programming stuff like art and music

- Webscraping Lyrics
	- Web app
	- How to use APIs
	Adv:
		- First time doing proper web stuff
		- Potentially super useful
	Disadv:
		- 3rd party software is prone to breaking

- 2D Game Prototype
	- Map generation algorithms
	- Graphics 
	- Events
	Adv:
		- More opportunity to learn compared to single-input
		- Can be easily incremented/good deliverable/milestones
		- Can be modified into different projects
	Disadv:
		- Threads
		- Final product relies on a lot of non-programming stuff like art and music

- Smart Flash Cards
	- Priotity queues
	- Probability & Statistics
	- Can be done with multiple different algorithms
	Adv:
		- Simple
	Disadv:
		- Not likely to be useful
		- Difficult to expand on/deliverables aren't as incremental

- Social Media Bots
	- Reddit, Twitter, Discord
	- APIs
	Adv:
		- Fun
		- Flexible/many languages
		- Potentially useful
	Disadv:
		- If usefulness is a goal, competition
		- Easy to break
		- File structure can end up being messy
